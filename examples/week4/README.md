## Overview

In Week 4, we'll tackle advanced topics to enhance the performance, deployability, and real-world applicability of your sea turtle re-identification system. After learning the foundational techniques for building and training models in previous weeks, we'll now focus on:

1. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models for improved accuracy
2. **Model Deployment**: Packaging and deploying models for real-world use
3. **Real-World Considerations**: Handling data drift, model interpretability, and image quality challenges

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Ensemble Methods for Improved Accuracy

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to achieve better performance than any single model. In this exercise, you'll implement and evaluate different ensemble techniques:

#### 1.1: Model Ensembling

Implement different model ensembling techniques:

```python
python ensemble_methods/ensemble_inference.py --models_dir /path/to/models --data_dir /path/to/test_data --output_dir /path/to/results
```

This script allows you to:

- Combine predictions from multiple models (averaging, weighted voting)
- Evaluate the ensemble performance against individual models
- Visualize the improvement in accuracy and robustness

**Key Concepts:**

- Diversity in ensemble models
- Handling prediction aggregation
- Confidence calibration

#### 1.2: Feature-Level Fusion

Implement feature-level fusion of different models:

```python
python ensemble_methods/model_fusion.py --backbone1 resnet50 --backbone2 efficientnet_b0 --data_dir /path/to/data --output_dir /path/to/output
```

This exercise demonstrates:

- How to extract and combine features from different backbones
- Training a meta-model on the combined features
- Comparing performance against individual models

### Exercise 2: Model Deployment

Learn how to deploy your trained models for real-world use:

#### 2.1: Model Optimization and Conversion

Convert your PyTorch models to optimized formats:

```python
python deployment/model_conversion/onnx_export.py --model_path /path/to/model.pth --output_path /path/to/model.onnx
```

Try model quantization to reduce size and improve inference speed:

```python
python deployment/model_conversion/quantization.py --model_path /path/to/model.onnx --output_path /path/to/model_quantized.onnx --quantization_type dynamic
```

**Key Concepts:**

- ONNX model format
- Quantization techniques (dynamic, static, per-channel)
- Performance vs. accuracy tradeoffs

#### 2.2: Building an API

Create a REST API for your re-identification system:

```python
cd deployment/api
python app.py --model_path /path/to/model.onnx --port 8000
```

Test your API with:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@/path/to/turtle_image.jpg" http://localhost:8000/identify
```

This exercise covers:

- Building a FastAPI application
- Handling image uploads
- Returning identification results with confidence scores

#### 2.3: Mobile Deployment

Prepare your model for mobile deployment:

```python
python deployment/mobile/tflite_converter.py --model_path /path/to/model.pth --output_path /path/to/model.tflite
```

**Key Concepts:**

- TensorFlow Lite conversion
- Model size optimization
- Mobile inference constraints

### Exercise 3: Real-World Considerations

Address challenges that arise when deploying models in real-world scenarios:

#### 3.1: Detecting and Handling Data Drift

Learn to detect when your data distribution changes:

```python
python real_world/data_drift/drift_detection.py --reference_data /path/to/training_data --current_data /path/to/new_data --output_dir /path/to/drift_report
```

Implement adaptation techniques to maintain performance:

```python
python real_world/data_drift/model_adaptation.py --model_path /path/to/model.pth --adaptation_data /path/to/new_data --output_model /path/to/adapted_model.pth
```

**Key Concepts:**

- Statistical drift detection
- Embedding space analysis
- Continuous learning strategies

#### 3.2: Model Explainability

Make your model's decisions interpretable:

```python
python real_world/explainability/feature_importance.py --model_path /path/to/model.pth --image_path /path/to/image.jpg --output_path /path/to/importance_map.jpg
```

Generate attention maps to visualize areas the model focuses on:

```python
python real_world/explainability/attention_maps.py --model_path /path/to/model.pth --image_path /path/to/image.jpg --output_path /path/to/attention_map.jpg
```

**Key Concepts:**

- Gradient-based attribution methods
- Class activation mapping
- Interpreting model decisions

#### 3.3: Image Quality Assessment and Enhancement

Filter low-quality images that could lead to incorrect identifications:

```python
python real_world/image_quality/quality_filter.py --input_dir /path/to/images --output_dir /path/to/filtered_images --threshold 0.6
```

Enhance image quality for better identification:

```python
python real_world/image_quality/enhancement.py --input_dir /path/to/low_quality_images --output_dir /path/to/enhanced_images
```

**Key Concepts:**

- Blur and noise detection
- Underwater image enhancement
- Quality-aware identification

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Week 4, you will be able to:

1. Create ensemble models that outperform individual models
2. Deploy your re-identification system via web APIs and mobile platforms
3. Make your system robust to real-world challenges like data drift and poor image quality
4. Provide explanations for your model's decisions

## Tips for Success

- **Integration is Key**: Focus on how these components work together rather than just individual implementations
- **Measure Performance Tradeoffs**: For each optimization, measure both the benefit (e.g., speed improvement) and the cost (e.g., accuracy loss)
- **Think About End Users**: Consider how researchers and conservationists will interact with your system
- **Documentation**: Document your API endpoints, expected inputs/outputs, and error handling
