# Turtle Tinder üê¢ Sea Turtle Re-Identification Curriculum

This repository is part of a comprehensive 4-week curriculum on building a sea turtle re-identification system. The curriculum guides you through creating a deep learning system that can recognize individual sea turtles from images.

## [Week 1: Data Preparation and Baseline CNN Models](week1/README.md)

- Understanding the problem domain and data handling
- Setting up a structured dataset of sea turtle images
- Implementing preprocessing and augmentation techniques
- Building a baseline CNN classifier
- Evaluating initial model performance

## [Week 2: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Advanced CNNs](week2/README.md)

- Leveraging pre-trained models (ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Understanding fine-tuning strategies and best practices
- Implementing advanced training techniques
- Comparing model architectures
- Significantly improving identification accuracy

## [Week 3: Metric Learning and Face-Recognition-Style Re-Identification](week3/README.md)

- Moving from classification to similarity learning
- Implementing Siamese networks and triplet loss
- Exploring specialized losses like ArcFace
- Learning embedding spaces for turtle comparison
- Evaluating re-identification performance

## [Week 4: Open-Set Recognition and Deployment](week4/README.md)

- Implementing open-set recognition for new turtles
- Building a system to track and update individual identities
- Evaluating with appropriate metrics (Rank-1, mAP)
- Deploying the model as a web API (this repository!)
- Planning for long-term system maintenance

The FastAPI application in this repository represents the culmination of the Week 4 deployment module, providing a practical implementation of the sea turtle re-identification system.

Happy turtle identifying! üê¢‚ú®
